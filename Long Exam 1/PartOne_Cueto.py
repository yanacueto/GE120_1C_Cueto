1. Differentiate Procedural Programming from Functional Programming.
Programming, in general, is done in order alleviate a problem through the use of codes and logical operations. In Procedural 
Programming, it does exactly that, but it is straightforward and you just set variables to have reflected values ready for printing.
Kagaya po ng ginawa natin sa Machine Exercise 1, nag-set tayo ng values per variable tapos ginamitan natin ng operations para
makuha natin yung desired results natin, which are in DMS and DD. Usually, procedural programming ends up being long since manually 
logged yung codes natin and isa-isa natin siyang ilagay. Kumbaga hindi siya in bulk?

However, in Functional Programming, we still abide by the principles of programming but we introduce a new aspect: functions. They 
make coding look neater because they can group a set of codes and be defined in one function so when you want to use them again, 
pwedeng yung function na lang yung gamitin natin ulit kasi set na yung script nung code in that function. It's also easier to edit
because we can just edit the definition of the function itself kaysa sa manual na pag-eedit per line, which can cause more mistakes -
similar to our Machine Exercise 3.


2. How does Git help in the Collaborative Development and Version Control environment of programming?
Personally, I think it's very cool how we have a certain website or software where we could see other people's works, to compare or 
collaborate with them and the likes. When this was introduced in our second meeting, I found it cool how we could apply the concept 
of team work despite working remotely. Git introduces a variety of functions, like clone (which clones a repository) and blame (which 
lets one know who wrote which code). It's so cool how we could even branch out new versions of the code without modifying the main 
code so more people could put their incentives in it. Overall, it just provides an avenue to work around the code but with more 
heads in tow.


3. When should we use a while loop and when should we use a for loop? Give examples in the field of geomatics.
A sentinel-controlled loop (while loop) is used when the user wants the code to continue running for n number of times until it
finds a value which is deemed untrue. A counter-controlled loop (for loop) is usually seen when one wants to specify the range where
an element is included.

In the field of geomatics, I can say we can use both of these loops in computing the traverse. Similar to our machine exercises, we 
can use a while loop  in ensuring that the formula holds for all lines included, since the process of solving for the traverse is very
procedural and repetitive, while we can use a for loop in specifying what format or actions must be done further in a specific portion 
of that code. Pwede rin po nating magamit ang for loop kapag gusto nating may specific na mangyari sa index na iyon ng list.


4. Discuss the Divide and Conquer paradigm in programming.
The Divide and Conquer paradigm in programming talks about how a main problem is divided into subproblems where these subproblems are
solved and the solutions to these subproblems would be merged in order to find a way to solve the main problem at hand. Basically,
it's backed up by the saying that "a little thing can make a big difference". (I have no idea if tunay na kasabihan iyon pero gets niyo
naman po siguro me...) These small solutions can pile up and be combined to remove the biggest problem, since they're factors of the 
main problem in the first place. By doing this, we ensure that we not only figured how to work our way around the big problem, but also
so we can avoid issues with the subproblems in the future.


5. Give an example of a task related to geomatics that is done manually and can be optimized using programming. What would be your
plan-of-attack for this solution?
Since I haven't dug deep in the field of geomatics yet given that I'm still in my first year, all I can think about is how we can 
make calculations for surveying and levelling easier. Not just through encoding in Google Sheets but through Python code as well. With 
our exercises, I think of creating an app (as an ambisyosa na hindi talaga mahal ng coding kahit nae-enjoy q siya kasi fulfilling
makagawa ng code na gumagana T_T) that can be downloaded in mobile phones to alleviate the stress of logging in and out via the 
internet because it would be available to use without it.
